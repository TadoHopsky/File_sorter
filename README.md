# File content sorter.    
#### This utility allows you to input a file in input.txt format, which can contain :
1. `Intager`
2. `String`
3. `Float`

#### Then the utility chants this file and creates `3 additional files`, respectively `ints.txt` | `strings.txt` | `floats.txt`.

#### If the source file contains variables of `Int` type, they will be written to the `ints.txt` file.
   
#### If the source file contains variables of `string` type, they will be written to the `strings.txt` file.
   
#### If the source file contains variables of `float` type, they will be written to the `floats.txt` file.
